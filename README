= UPDATED

This is based on work for Rails 1.1.X to support bundling dependencies. With all the recent work around 
bundler and isolate, I wanted to birng this back.




= Introduction

One sentence summary: "Everything is a gem, most things work from within the gem, and all dependencies are accounted for."

More details can be found on http://revolutiononrails.blogspot.com/2007/05/release-plugems-runtime.html

= Installation Guide:

== Install it on your box:

As a gem:
gem install plugems

== Create your plugem configuration:

Add config/manifest.yml describing your plugem and its dependencies:

:version: [1, 0]
:name: "cool_application"
:description: "My First Plugemified Application"
:dependencies:
  - ['some_gem', '~> 1.0']
  - ['other_gem', '> 2.0']
  - ['one_more', '2.0.1']


== Bootstrap the plugems:

Add the plugems requirement to config/boot.rb at the bottom right before the initializer call:

  # Add this line:
  require_gem 'plugems', '~> 1.0'

  Rails::Initializer.run(:set_load_path)
end


= License
